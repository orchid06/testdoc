## Local Installation

You can easily install BeePost on your local development environment using popular tools like XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP, or Laragon. Follow these steps to set up the software locally:

**Database Setup**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Laragon">
    Open the XAMPP Control Panel. You can do this by searching for "XAMPP Control Panel" and running it as an administrator.

    <img
        className="block"
        src="/images/start_xampp.png"
        alt="Start Xampp"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Apache and MySQL">
    In the XAMPP Control Panel, click the "Start" button next to "Apache" and "MySQL." This will start the Apache web server and MySQL database server.

    <img
        className="block"
        src="/images/start_xampp.png"
        alt="Start Xampp"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access phpMyAdmin">
    Open your web browser and type the following URL into the address bar: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to phpMyAdmin">
    You will be taken to the phpMyAdmin login page. Log in with the default credentials:
    <ul>
      <li>Username: root</li>
      <li>Password: (Leave this field empty)</li>
    </ul>
    Note: If you've set a password for MySQL during XAMPP installation or later, use that password instead of leaving it empty.

        className="block"
        src="/images/access_php.png"
        alt="Start Xampp"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Database">
    On the phpMyAdmin dashboard, click on the "Databases" tab located at the top. In the "Create database" section, enter a name for your new database in the "Database name" field. Choose the appropriate collation (usually, you can leave it as the default). Click the "Create" button.

    <img
        className="block"
        src="/images/new_database.png"
        alt="Start Xampp"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You will receive a confirmation message indicating that the database has been created successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note> Please note down the Database Username, Database Name, Database Host, and Database Password for a later part of this installation process.</Note>

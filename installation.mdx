You can easily install BeePost on your local development environment using popular tools like XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP, or Laragon. Follow these steps to set up the software locally:

**Database Setup**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Laragon">
    Open the XAMPP Control Panel. You can do this by searching for "XAMPP Control Panel" and running it as an administrator.

      <li>Username: root</li>
      <li>Password: (Leave this field empty)</li>
    </ul>
    Note: If you've set a password for MySQL during XAMPP installation or later, use that password instead of leaving it empty.
